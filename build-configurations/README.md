# Build Configurations

The JSON files in this directory are intended to feed into <a href="https://mustache.github.io" target="_blank">Mustache</a> templates in the `templates/` directory. By default, all files in this directory other than `DEFAULT.json` are excluded from version control. However, the files in `build-configurations/examples` are not excluded, so any configuration worth sharing should go there.
